Design and edit schedules without worrying about collisions between rooms or teachers. Also, you can build a schedule from scratch by generating lectures automatically you just have to provide the essential information such as how many hours in a week a subject needs to be lectured. However, you can add a subject in a pre-built schedule so that the lectures generator can place your lectures in collision-free places.

{: .prompt-tip}


We often need to change a lecture place from time to time, (teachers or students don't like their schedule... etc.). In this case, you don't need more than dragging and dropping this lecture, and if there is another schedule that has a lecture with the same teacher or room in the dropped place you will face a collision detection red flash. that will tell you all collision information without any text using only interactive UI design. Red flashy (schedule name, teacher name, room name, ... etc.) that indicates a collision place and reason.

You can run the project easily in a development server following the [Angular instructions](#angular-development-environment) at the end of this file. 

> Clone or Download the code of the [localStorage-NoBackend](https://github.com/Ahmad-Alkaf/Schedule-Builder/tree/localStorage-NoBackend) branch because it can run without any server configuration and it will save schedules' information in the browser's local storage instead of the main branch which was built with backend server capability using ASP.NET to store data in a Database. Which is not needed for such a program. But as you know university stuff...

There are many features such as **Print a schedule**, **Copy** / **cut** / **paste** a lecture within a schedule or between different schedules, and more... But I will let the reader find out these and other features by using the app [here](https://schedule-builder.kaflabs.com).

## Summary

Web application to build schedules of lectures. The user starts by adding the available subjects, teachers, and rooms. Then the user creates a schedule by either dragging and dropping lectures or letting the system generate it by only determining the weekly hours of a lecture. Open source at the link provided.

- Built using Angular framework.
- Automatically generate a schedule free of collision. Using Backtracking algorithm.
- Drag and drop lectures.
- Collision detection between different schedules’ rooms or teachers.
